# How To: Categorize Snails by Speed

The fastest snails can move at speeds up to 0.7 miles per hour. How can we classify and categorize the speed of any snail? Find out. 

### Snail Speed Data

* **Garden Snails** *aka Cornu Aspersum* move at 1 mm per second.

* **Banana Slugs** are known for extreme slowness, observed to move at only 6.5 inches in 120 minutes.





> *SNAIL FACT: most snails are slow.*

## Instructions
1. Use a ruler to measure speed in mm per minute.
2. Note your snail speed (digitally or on paper).
3. Compare different snails' speeds to each other and organize by fastest to slowest (loser snails).



## Conclusion
It doesn't really matter how fast the snails are. They would never compete with a fast animal, such as a cheetah.
